# Quick Setup Guide

## Current Status
The application is now working, but you need to set up the database tables for the role permissions system.

## What's Fixed
✅ Fixed `User.updateMyUserData is not a function` error  
✅ Fixed user role handling logic  
✅ Auto-assigns Admin role to existing users  
✅ Fixed currentUser access issues  

## Next Steps

### 1. Set Up Database Tables
You need to run the SQL script in your Supabase dashboard:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy the contents of `initialize-role-permissions.sql`
4. Paste and run the SQL script
5. Refresh the application

### 2. What the SQL Script Does
- Creates `roles` table with default roles (Admin, Director, Manager, Staff, Client)
- Creates `permissions` table with all page names
- Creates `role_permissions` table to link roles with permissions
- Sets up default permissions for each role
- Enables Row Level Security (RLS)

### 3. After Running the SQL Script
- The application will automatically load role configurations from the database
- You can manage user roles in the User Management page
- Navigation will be filtered based on user roles
- No more "Database tables do not exist" errors

### 4. Current User Status
Your user (mitchell@lysaght.net.nz) will be automatically assigned the "Admin" role when you refresh the page, giving you full access to all features.

## Files to Run
- `initialize-role-permissions.sql` - Run this in Supabase SQL Editor

## Expected Result
After running the SQL script and refreshing:
- No more console errors about missing tables
- Full access to the application
- User Management page will work properly
- Role-based navigation will be active
