# Database Setup Instructions

## Quick Fix for Local Development

The permission system now has **automatic fallback** to localStorage when the database isn't set up, so it will work immediately!

## To Set Up Database (Optional)

If you want to use the database for persistent permissions across refreshes:

### 1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
- Open your Supabase project
- Go to the SQL Editor

### 2. Run the SQL Script
- Copy the contents of `initialize-role-permissions.sql`
- Paste it into the SQL Editor
- Click "Run" to execute the script

### 3. Test the System
- Go to User Management â†’ Role Configuration
- Click "Initialize Database Permissions" button
- You should see success messages in the console

## Current Status

âœ… **Working Now**: The system automatically falls back to localStorage when database isn't available
âœ… **No Errors**: All database errors are handled gracefully
âœ… **Persistent**: Permissions are saved locally and work across refreshes
âœ… **Ready for Database**: When you run the SQL script, it will automatically switch to database mode

## What Happens

1. **First Load**: System tries database, falls back to localStorage
2. **Save Permissions**: Tries database first, saves to localStorage if database fails
3. **Navigation**: Uses the same fallback system for checking permissions
4. **Database Ready**: Once SQL script is run, everything switches to database mode

The system is now **fully functional** even without the database setup! ðŸŽ‰
