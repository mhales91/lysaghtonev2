Our engineering consultancy will undertake detailed analysis of soil permeability, groundwater levels, and existing drainage patterns, coupled with the assessment of potential environmental impacts. This will ensure compliance with local Auckland regulations and environmental standards, providing sustainable soakage solutions that effectively manage stormwater runoff while minimizing detrimental effects on surrounding ecosystems.

Following the initial assessment, we will develop a detailed soakage design plan that outlines the proposed methodologies for stormwater management. This plan will include the specifications for soakage pits or trenches, calculations for sizing based on peak runoff rates, and technical drawings necessary for construction. We will also provide recommendations for maintenance and monitoring to ensure the long-term effectiveness of the soakage system. Ongoing collaboration with the client and relevant stakeholders is essential throughout the project to ensure that all designs meet functional requirements and regulatory obligations.
